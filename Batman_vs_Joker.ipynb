Let’s assume that you want to transmit a message x to Batman. You will apply your encryption function E to x and send the encrypted message E(x) over the link; Batman, upon receiving E(x), will then apply his decryption function D to it and thus recover the original message.\n",

    "<h1>Modular Arithmetic</h1>\n",
    "In several settings, such as error-correcting codes and cryptography, we sometimes wish to work over a smaller range of numbers. Modular arithmetic is useful in these settings, since it limits numbers to a predefined range {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}, and wraps around whenever you try to leave this range — like the hand of a clock (where N = 12) or the days of the week (where N = 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Example: Calculating the time.</h4>\n",
    "When you calculate the time, you automatically use modular arithmetic. For example, if you are asked what time it will be 13 hours from 1 pm, you say 2 am rather than 14. Let’s assume our clock displays 12 as 0. This is limiting numbers to a predefined range, {0,1,2,...,11}. Whenever you add two numbers in this setting, you divide by 12 and provide the remainder as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we can define x mod m (in words: “x modulo m”) to be the remainder r when we divide x bym. I.e.,if $x$ $mod$ $m$ $=$ $r$, then $x=mq+r$ where $0≤r≤m−1$ and $q$ is an integer. Thus 13 $mod$ 12=1."
